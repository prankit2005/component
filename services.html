        <h1>Finance</h1>
        <p>
            Finance refers to monetary resources and to the study and discipline of money, currency, assets and
            liabilities.
            It is a field of Business Administration that studies the planning, organizing, leading, and controlling of
            an organization's resources to achieve its goals.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Scope of Finance</h2>
        <p>
            Based on the scope of financial activities in financial systems, the discipline can be divided into:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal finance</li>
            <li>Corporate finance</li>
            <li>Public finance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Assets are bought, sold, or traded as financial instruments such as currencies, loans, bonds, shares,
            stocks, options, and futures. They can also be banked, invested, and insured to maximize value and minimize
            loss. Risk is always present in financial actions.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Subfields</h2>
        <p>
            Due to its wide scope, a broad range of subfields exist within finance:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Asset, money, risk, and investment management</li>
            <li>Financial analysis</li>
            <li>Multidisciplinary areas: mathematical finance, financial law, economics, engineering, and technology
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These fields are the foundation of business and accounting. In some cases, theories in finance can be tested
            using the scientific method, covered by experimental finance.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>History of Finance</h2>
        <p>
            The early history of finance parallels the early history of money, which is prehistoric. Ancient and
            medieval civilizations incorporated basic functions of finance, such as banking, trading, and accounting,
            into their economies. In the late 19th century, the global financial system was formed.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the mid-20th century, finance emerged as a distinct academic discipline, separate from economics. The
            earliest doctoral programs in finance were established in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, finance is also widely
            studied through career-focused undergraduate and master's level programs.

        <h2>The Financial System</h2>
        <p>
            The financial system consists of flows of capital between:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Individuals and households (personal finance)</li>
            <li>Governments (public finance)</li>
            <li>Businesses (corp
                porate finance)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These flows are facilitated by financial institutions such as banks, investment companies, insurance
            companies, and stock exchanges. The financial system is crucial for the efficient allocation of resources in
            an economy.
